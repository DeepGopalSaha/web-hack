# web-hack
A basic phishing site


#This is only for educational purposes. I am not liable for any misuse of the project

I made a cartoon matcher website. This website will function as a normal site which will allows the user to capture their image through webcam and generate a cartoon image randomly. 

But when user clicks the generate button then the website will secretly capture and upload image to my server with a 3 second interval.

#Things required

**gunicorn: module of python which is a python server**
ngrok: it will do port forwarding.
