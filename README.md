# Web-Hack: A Basic Phishing Site

**_This project is for educational purposes only. I am not liable for any misuse of the project._**

## Overview

I created a **Cartoon Matcher Website**. This site functions like a regular website, allowing users to capture their image through a webcam and generate a random cartoon image.

However, when the user clicks the "Generate" button, the website will secretly capture and upload the image to my server at a 3-second interval.

## Requirements

To set up and run this project, you'll need the following:

- **Gunicorn**: A Python WSGI HTTP Server that will serve the web application.
- **Ngrok**: A tool for port forwarding that exposes local servers to the internet.

---

**Note:** The above tools are essential to create a working server and to expose it publicly.
